/**
 * @fileoverview This patches tsickle's decorator transformer exported from `decorator.ts` module
 * into a no-op transformer, see {@link https://github.com/angular/tsickle/issues/1164}. what
 * tsickle's transformer does is logical copy of what we have been doing, which chronologically
 * came later. In tscc, we in addition adds property access statements that is going to be removed
 * after closure compilation. Tsickle's transformation loses some information -- we need to know
 * what _decorate call is the ones we are concerned with, but for example, after tsickle's
 * transformation, one cannot distinguish [__tsickle_googReflect(...)]() { ... } with the one
 * generated by tsickle. Also, there are subtle differences concerning es3 output (which is ts's
 * default target).
